# ESP8266 / ESP8285 Lora Transmitter

Connect a small length of wire to the "RX" pin on your ESP8266, then it will transmit SF10 LoRa messages at 904.6MHz, with channel width of 500kHz. 

Be sure to configure your receiver to specifically use SF10, 500kHz, on 904.6MHz.  Many commercial receivers cannot automatically negotiate 500kHz channels.
